This version of the program auto-generates a config file and then prompts the user to either edit the config file to input their camera/recording parameters, or to use the default settings as-is by copy-pasting the default config file's filepath.

The program then carries out a timed recording as per the config file's settings. Double-clicking the "TXT_CAM.desktop" file on the Raspberry Pi desktop should launch the python script. Conversely, the command line can be used to run the script using Python3.
