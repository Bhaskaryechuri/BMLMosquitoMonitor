# BMLMosquitoMonitor

This repository contains all files & instructions needed to recreate the BML Mosquito Monitor including:
- Mechanical design files needed for laser-cutting
- A copy of the entire Raspberry Pi image (most efficient way of replicating the BMLMM Software and settings on a new Raspberry Pi)
- Latest version of the BMLBox App Code (already present in the RPi Image, but helpful when iterating on the software)
